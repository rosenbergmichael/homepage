      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>Motivated full stack web developer with a business background, I thrive in a collaborative environment where I can utilize my strong communication and problem solving skills. My previous role in the Customer Experience space formally introduced me to the companies and technologies responsible for creating better, more seamless customer/user experiences, and this is what led me to pursue a career in software development. I'm seeking a new challenge that will grant me the opportunity to improve our digital experiences firsthand. Passionate about new adventures and a strong believer in never being too old to continue growing and learning new things.</p>

      <p>Currently a Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux developer with a strong desire to add more programming languages to my toolbelt. I am excited to bring my skill set to a team where together we can solve problems and create amazing digital products and services!</p>
